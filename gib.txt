Welcome to CS 1181! This is my favorite course to teach, and I'm looking forward to this semester. 

Our first lecture is on Monday at 9:05 via Collaborate. If you can, please take a little time before then to look at the course syllabus and the Pilot site for the lab portion of the course. You'll also need to complete the Course Agreement, available in the lab site.

There will be no labs the first week of the semester, so your first lab will be via Collaborate on Tuesday, January 19th with Quinn Hirt.

If you have any questions or concerns before then, please don't hesitate to ask me (michelle.cheatham@wright.edu) or, if it's about the lab, Quinn (hirt.14@wright.edu)

Have a great weekend!

-Dr. Cheatham
